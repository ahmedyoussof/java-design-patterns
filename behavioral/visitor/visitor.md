# Visitor Pattern

## 1. What is it?
- It is a behavioral design pattern that defines a way to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It enables adding new operations to existing objects without modifying their structure.

## 2. What are the pros?
- **Separation of Concerns:**
    - It separates the algorithm or operation from the elements it operates on, promoting a cleaner design.
- **Extensibility:**
    - It allows for the easy addition of new operations or algorithms without modifying the visited elements.
- **Open/Closed Principle:**
    - It adheres to the Open/Closed Principle, allowing the addition of new visitors without modifying existing elements.
- **Centralized Operations:**
    - It centralizes related operations in a visitor, making it easier to manage and extend.

## 3. What are the cons?
- **Complexity:**
    - The pattern can introduce complexity, especially when there are numerous types of elements and visitors.
- **Element Modification:**
    - Adding a new type of element may require modifying all existing visitors, which can be a drawback in some scenarios.

## 4. When to consider using it?
- Use the Visitor Pattern when you have a set of elements with distinct types and want to perform various operations on them without modifying their classes.
- Use it when the elements' structure is stable, but you anticipate frequent changes or additions to the operations performed on them.
