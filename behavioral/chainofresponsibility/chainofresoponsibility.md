# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

## 1. What is it?
- It is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

## 2. What are the pros?
- **Decoupling:**
    - It decouples senders and receivers, allowing them to work independently.
- **Flexibility:**
    - It provides a flexible way of handling requests with multiple handlers.
- **Dynamic Chain:**
    - The chain of handlers can be dynamically modified or extended during runtime.

## 3. What are the cons?
- **Guaranteed Handling:**
    - There's no guarantee that a request will be handled; it might reach the end of the chain without being processed.
- **Complexity:**
    - The pattern can introduce complexity, and inappropriate use may result in an unmanageable number of handlers.

## 4. When to consider using it?
- Use the Chain of Responsibility Pattern when you want to decouple senders and receivers of a request.
- Use it when multiple objects may handle a request, and the handler is not known at compile time.
