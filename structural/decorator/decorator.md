# Decorator Pattern

## 1. What is it?
- It is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

## 2. What are the pros?
- **Open/Closed Principle:**
    - You can introduce new functionality without modifying existing code.
- **Flexibility:**
    - You can combine different decorators to create various combinations of behavior.

## 3. What are the cons?
- **Complexity:**
    - The system can become complex with a large number of decorators.

## 4. When to consider using it?
- Use the Decorator Pattern when you need to add responsibilities to objects dynamically and extend behavior without altering code.
- Use it to avoid the need for subclassing.
