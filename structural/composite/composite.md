# Composite Pattern

## 1. What is it?
- It is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## 2. What are the pros?
- **Uniformity:**
    - It provides a consistent way to treat both individual objects and compositions of objects.
- **Simplifies Client Code:**
    - Clients can interact with complex structures without needing to distinguish between individual and composite objects.
- **Flexibility:**
    - It allows you to build complex structures using simple building blocks.

## 3. What are the cons?
- **Complexity:**
    - The pattern can make the code more complex, especially if the structure is not well-defined.
- **Performance:**
    - There might be a performance impact when working with deeply nested structures.

## 4. When to consider using it?
- Use the Composite Pattern when you want clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- Use it when you need to represent part-whole hierarchies that can be composed of both individual objects and their compositions.
