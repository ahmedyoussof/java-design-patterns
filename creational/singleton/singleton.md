# Singleton Pattern

## 1. What is it?
- It is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## 2. What are the pros?
- **Single Instance:**
    - Ensures that there is only one instance of the class.
- **Global Access:**
    - Provides a global point of access to the instance, allowing easy sharing of resources.
- **Lazy Initialization:**
    - The instance is created only when it is first requested, improving performance.

## 3. What are the cons?
- **Global State:**
    - The singleton pattern introduces a global state, which might make the system less modular.
- **Testing Difficulties:**
    - Singleton instances can be challenging to test due to their global nature.

## 4. When to consider using it?
- Use the Singleton Pattern when you need to ensure a single point of control or coordination.
- Use it when a single instance must be shared and accessed globally in the system.
