# Builder Pattern

## 1. What is it?
- It is a creational design pattern that allows constructing complex objects step by step.
- It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

## 2. What are the pros?
- **Step-by-step construction:**
    - It allows constructing a product step by step, providing more control over the construction process.
- **Reusability:**
    - The same construction process can be used to create different representations of the product.
- **Product Variations:**
    - It allows creating different variations of a product by varying the construction process.

## 3. What are the cons?
- **Complexity:**
    - The code can become more complex, especially if there are many optional features or variations in the product.
- **Requires Creating Concrete Builders:**
    - You need to create concrete builder classes for each variation of the product.

## 4. When to consider using it?
- Use the Builder Pattern when you need to construct complex objects with a step-by-step approach, and the construction process might result in different representations of the same product.
- Use it when you want to encapsulate the construction process and allow for the creation of different product variations without modifying the client code.
